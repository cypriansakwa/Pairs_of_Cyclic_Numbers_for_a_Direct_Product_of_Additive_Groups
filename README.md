This Rust code consists of multiple functions that work together to find and output pairs of cyclic numbers (n,m) up to a certain limit such that the group Z_n x Z_m is cyclic. 

Here's an overview of the functions and their responsibilities:

1. GCD Calculation function computes the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Coprime Check function checks if two numbers are coprime.
3. The generate_cyclic_pairs function iterates through all pairs (n,m) up to the specified limit and checks if they are coprime. If they are, it adds the pair to the list of results.
4. Main Function which sets the limit and prints the generated pairs.
